2.7 Reflection

1. How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

I found it was very enjoyable wireframing as a pair. We used a timer to switch between driver and navigator. We were able to collaborate easily using a wireframing webapp that allowed us to make live updates to the same document. (https://moqups.com/)

2.  Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

I absolutely believe the wireframing process was helpful to our development process. After knowing "visually" what we wanted, laying out the HTML was very quick and efficient. It would have been much more difficult to create the HTML without the wireframe as reference.

3.What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We decided that in order to make a good wireframe that we could both share and develop on our own, that it would be necessary to make it fairly "low fidelity". Low fidelity means that it is intentionally made without details so as to only suggest what the frame and order of things would be. We did not use colors and stuck with simple shapes and common patterns.

4. What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I recently took an HTML5 class where much of what I learned was how to write HTML5 semantically using new sectioning elements. I will say that I did have to check to make sure that we were using <article>, <aside>, and <nav> correctly. As a pair we both verfied that these elements were used correctly.
