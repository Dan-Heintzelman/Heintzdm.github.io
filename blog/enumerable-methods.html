		<h4>Method Acting - Be the Method!</h4>
			<p>As most of you probably know, the art of method acting is about learning to act like a role by become that role! When I first heard the concept of an <q>Enumerable</q> method, I had no idea what it meant. I'm assuming most of you reading this have just learned what it is, so I don't think it will hurt you to get some resolidification (hopefully that's a word), of the subject matter.
			</p>
			<p> An enumerable is a module with a collection of methods that get <q>Mixed in</q> with other classes. I think of this as being like a toolbelt for a superhero. A superhero may have innate abilities such as super strength or laser vision, but the tool belt gives them added abilities.For instance, both of the classes Array and Hash include the enumerable module, so we know that methods such as .map, and .collect are able to be called on objects with the class Hash or Array. Admiral Array and Heroic Hash both make excellent heroes, but with their enumerable methods, they are unstoppable! There are quite a few enumerable methods out there, but I am going to choose one to discuss about in detail today. Please check out your <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Enumerable.html" target="_blank">Ruby docs reference</a> to read about all of the enumerable methods currently out there.

		<h4>My Super Enumerable - .Select</h4>
		<p>A very useful enumerable method I'm going to teach you today is the <code>.select</code> method. Select comes in both destructive! and not destructive varieties. It's job is to run the code you specify between the code block {code here} on every item in the object and return only items that return true after running the code. I will demonstrate a commonly used, but very helpful bit of code to return even numbers</p>

		<code>
 				super_array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] <br>
 				> super_array.select { |num| num % 2 == 0 } <br>
				=> [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] <br>
		</code>
		<p>
			There you have it! One quick line of code and you can pull out thousands of even numbers from an array. If you want to store them in a new array, you can go ahead and assign the result to a variable. Otherwise, if you prefer to change the value of super_array to the newly returned even numbers, you can use <code>.select!</code> instead!.
