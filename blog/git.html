  <h1>What is version control, git, and github</h1>
  <h2>From my brain to yours</h2>

      Let's start out with the basics. What is version control? Well, quite simply, it's a system that allows developers to keep track of the changes to all of their files. It tells them what changes have been made to a folder,file, or even a sentence within a file.  It also allows them to see who made the change (for group projects), and at what time the change was made. No don't worry, even lazy people like me can take advantage of this crazy efficient system.

    <p>To express the dilemma of being without version control,I'm going to zoom back in time to when I was in gradeschool and starting to type my very own papers. I know you might be thinking... "gosh, how old is this guy?" Fortunately, not that old, I think I was using Microsoft Office when I started typing my first papers. If you were anything like me growing up, you would constantly be invoking “File > Save As” and making new versions of the same paper over and over and over again. This was more frequent when I felt like I was about to make an addition that was likely to be a bunch of gibberish.  Over time, this would become very complicated.  I could only see the date the older versions were modified, but I couldn’t for the life of me remember what the heck I changed.  In a desperate attempt to stay organized, I invented my own version control system where I would "Save As" a ton of times. The result would be loads of files on my computer with odd names like “Version1_kindofcrappy”, “Version2_OkNotBad” and, well...you get the point.

      Now that you know <i>why</i> developer's or for that matter, anyone, needs version control, let talk about one of the most popular version control system's out there, git.  Git essentially allows the content creator (you!), to be able to accomplish tracking without actually having to “Save As”. You get to keep just one file name, and anytime you want to make a new version, you just have to run certain commands to make sure that you mark the files for change. If you are working on a project, you will probably keep all of your files in one main folder, such as DansBlogPost. First I would tell GIT this is my repository by running the command "git init DansBlogPost". Now everything that is created within this directory has the ability to be tracked in a few simple commands.

      This is of course an oversimplified explanation of GIT, but I can tell you from personal experience that all the commands you need to start tracking files can be learned in just a few days. Now say you wanted to have 2,3, or even hundreds of other people collaborate on your project that you've already been tracking in GIT on your computer? This is where a most powerful tool comes in play, github.

        I think of GitHub as a giant home for all of my project’s code on the web. I can give keys for my home to all of my friends and they can come in and take an item out of my house, give it a nice addition (or subtraction), and then send the item right back into my house. Of course, I would likely be reviewing the change before it becomes a permanent part of my house. GitHub still uses the same Git repository system that you have on your computer, but it allows you to store your repository in a central place where many coders can collaborate on it at once. It also brings in a nice graphical web interface where changes can be seen easily right in your browser, from anywhere!  I hope this gives you a good introduction to what version control is, and a little bit about how you can use git and github to track your code and collaborate with others on it.
