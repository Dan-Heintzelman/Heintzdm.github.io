		<h4>Schools out For Summer</h4>
			<p> If you have read my blog posts before, you know that I love to use anologies to describe how things in the programming world work. As I was pondering the yonder, I realized that my anology for this blog post would be quite simple! A ruby class can be compared to a class room of students!
			</p>
			<p> In order to understand the value of classes in Ruby, its important to understand why we would use a class. Let's get back to the classroom, shall we. Every class room in a school is going to have many of the same different kinds of atrributes. Chairs, Students, lab equipment, teachers, etc. We know that it is inherent to a classroom, that we have these things. However, the value of these things is likely to be different between classrooms. (Unless the teachers and students are being cloned of course.) I don't have to create a new variable for every new teacher, or every new student, or every new piece of lab equipment. With a class structure, I define a class that accepts these inputs and allows them to be modified on many different intances (classrooms) in a cinch! Let's get to the code, shall we.

		<h4>Classes are Classy with Code</h4>

		<code>
 				class Classroom <br>
 <br>
				def initialize(student_count, seats, teacher,microscope_count,frog_legs) <br>
					@students = students <br>
					@teacher = teacher_name <br>
					@seats = seats <br>
				end <br>
<br>
				attr_accessor :student_count <br>
				attr_accessor :seats <br>
				attr_accessor :teacher_name <br>
				attr_accessor :microscope_acount <br>
				attr_accessor :frog_legs <br>
<br>
				def enough_seats <br>
					if @seats >= @student_count <br>
					puts "You have enough seat(s)!" <br>
					else <br>
					seat_req = @student_count - @seats <br>
					puts "You need #{seat_req} extra seats! <br>
 				end <br>
			end <br>
			#Driver Code <br>
			# dans_class = Classroom.new(3,2,"Mr D", 5, 6000) <br>
			# dans_class.enough_seats <br>
			#output = You need 1 extra seat(s)! <br>
			#dan_class.seats += 1<br>
			# dan_class.enough_seats<br>
			#output = "You have enough seats!"<br>

		</code>
		<p>
			As you can see here, Mr D's classroom needs 1 extra seat. This can now easily be tracked among many different classrooms.  Think about what other things can be done here. The attr_accessor will allow the user to change the values outside of the class. So if I need to fire Mr D, I can do so, or if I need to add more chairs to the <q>inventory</q> of this classroom, I now can easily, outside of the class. I hope thius helps to solidify your understanding of classes!
