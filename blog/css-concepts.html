		<h4>Display = Block</h4>
		<p>There are many ways use the display property in CSS. However, there is much confusion about the difference between inline and inline-block: To understand the difference between inline and inline block, it is first important to understand that HTML elements have difficult display values!
</p>
		<p>For instance, a (paragraph) element is a block level element by default. This means that if it were in code it would look like <code> display: block </code>. To make it easier for me, I think of a block element like a block in the game Tetris. To make a full block in Tetris, you have to fill up the whole entire line. A block level element takes up the entire line. So if you stack two paragraphs next to each other, they will display one on top of the other. </p>

		<h4>Display = Inline</h4>
		<p>If you have just started to learn HTML, you probably know by now that you can use certain elements to select code inside of paragraphs, like span, em, b, etc. These elements are inside of the block so they run <q>inline</q> with the block. These elements only take up as much space as they need to, unlike block level elements. However, what if you want to take two paragraphs and stack them up side by side?

		<h4>Display = Inline-Block</h4>
		<p>Both of the examples mentioned above do not require that you change the display property in CSS because they are all set that way by default.  However, letâ€™s say you want to take two block level elements (such as a paragraph), and set them side by side so they do not take up the entire <q>Tetris Block</q>. You can set the display property to the value of <q>Inline block</q>! This is a great alternative to floating an element. However, it is critical that if you use inline block to display two paragraphs together on the same line that you set the vertical align property to the value of top(look in my example). This will make certain that both paragraphs align to the top instead of the bottom.</p>
