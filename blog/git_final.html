		<h4> The Basics! Version Control</h4>
		<p>Let's start out with the basics. What is version control? Well, quite simply, it's a system that allows developers to keep track of the changes to all of their files. It tells them what changes have been made to a folder, file, or even a sentence within a file.  It also allows them to see who made the change (for group projects), and at what time the change was made. Your first thought might be that this is too difficult, but don't worry, even lazy people like me can take advantage of this easy to use system.</p>
		<p>To express the dilemma of being without version control, I'm going to zoom back in time to when I was in gradeschool when I was just starting to type my own papers.  I know you might be thinking... "gradeschool?, how old is this guy?" Fortunately, not that old. I think I was using Microsoft Office when I started typing my first papers. If you were anything like me growing up, you would constantly be invoking the <q>File > Save As</q> button and making new versions of the same paper over, and over, and over again.  Over time, this would become very complicated.  I could only see the date the older versions were modified, but I couldn’t for the life of me remember what the heck I changed.  In desperation, I had to invent my own version control system. This entailed repeating the "Save As" technique a ton of times, iterating each version with short names describing the change. The result would be loads of files on my computer with odd names like <q>Version1_kindofcrappy</q>, <q>Version2_OkNotBad</q> and, well...you get the point.</p>

			<h4><b>Git</b> with it!</h4>
		<p>Now that you know <i>why</i> developer's, or for that matter, anyone, needs version control, let's talk about one of the most popular version control system's out there, git.  Git essentially allows the content creator (you!), to be able to accomplish versioning and tracking without actually having to <q>Save As</q>. You get to keep just one file name, and anytime you want to make a new version, you just have to run a few simple commands to make sure that you mark the files for change. Any time you are ready to submit a major change, you can leave a comment about the change. This way, you don't have to leave your self depricating remarks in the filename (only kidding).  If you are working on a project, you will probably keep all of your files in one main folder, such as DansBlogPost. The way Git works is that you designate this main directory as your "repository".  All the content in this directory has the ability to be tracked, and Git can even tell when you have changed a file so that you can easily know when it's the right time to take a "snapshot", or as Git calls, a "commit".  Don't worry, your folders won't be oveflowing with all these changes and comments.  When you observe your files and folders through the "normal people" viewer (OS X finder or Windows Explorer), you will see only one copy.  All of the extra versions are nicely kept in a hidden folder called ".git" so as to not concern all the muggles (non coding folk) who might be sharing your server space.</p>

		<p>This is of course an oversimplified explanation of GIT.  However, I can tell you from personal experience that taking the leap from understanding what Git does, to how to use it, is achievable in just a few days. But wait!  Before turning all of your folders into git repositories, you need to know about Github. Let's say you wanted to have 2, 3, or even hundreds of other people collaborate on your project.  Well, you can, thanks to the fine folks who developed Github.</p>

			<h4>GitHub : The cloud for your code</h4>
			<p>I think of GitHub as a giant home for all of my project code to live on the web. I can give keys for my home to all of my friends and they can come in and take any item out of my house, give it a nice addition (or subtraction), and then send the item right back into my house. Of course, I would likely be reviewing the change before it becomes a permanent part of my house. In Git terms, each time I let something become part of my house again, it becomes a "merge". GitHub still uses the same Git repository system that you have on your computer, but it allows you to store your repository in a central place where many coders can collaborate on it at once. It also brings in a nice graphical web interface where changes can be seen easily right in your browser, from anywhere! Go ahead, use your finely honed navigating skills to get to www.github.com and create a free account.</p>
			<p>I hope this gives you a good understanding of what version control is, and a little bit about how you can use git and github to track your code and collaborate with others on it.</p>

2.7 Reflection

1. How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

I found it was very enjoyable wireframing as a pair. We used a timer to switch between driver and navigator. We were able to collaborate easily using a wireframing webapp that allowed us to make live updates to the same document. (https://moqups.com/)

2.  Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

I absolutely believe the wireframing process was helpful to our development process. After knowing "visually" what we wanted, laying out the HTML was very quick and efficient. It would have been much more difficult to create the HTML without the wireframe as reference.

3.What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We decided that in order to make a good wireframe that we could both share and develop on our own, that it would be necessary to make it fairly "low fidelity". Low fidelity means that it is intentionally made without details so as to only suggest what the frame and order of things would be. We did not use colors and stuck with simple shapes and common patterns.

4. What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I recently took an HTML5 class where much of what I learned was how to write HTML5 semantically using new sectioning elements. I will say that I did have to check to make sure that we were using <article>, <aside>, and <nav> correctly. As a pair we both verfied that these elements were used correctly.
