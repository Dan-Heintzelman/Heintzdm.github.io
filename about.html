  <h3>Bio</h3>
  <p>Hello Planet. (Trying not to be cliche here). My name is Dan Heintzelman.  I am first and foremost what one might call, a geek...and proud of it. My whole life I have been intrigued by what makes things work. Yes, I was that kid that put crayons in the VCR (remember those?). Not because I wanted to torture my parents, but because I've always been curious. Even though my niche is tech, I am fueled by a deep passion for music and the arts. I play guitar, djembe (African hand drum), and even a little bit on the set. I am from Cincinnati, but I live in Chicago.  Even though I live close to home, and like being in the midwest, I love to travel. I have worked in L.A., Orlando (Disney Imagineering), Italy (Study Abroad), and various other places. So, you might ask....what do I do?</p>
  <p>I have a Bachelor's Degree in Urban Planning from the University of Cincinnati. You may ask why this big tech geek was studying city planning. During my time at UC, I developed an interest and passion in the city as both a canvas for design, and as a vehicle for me to understand the intricacies of people and how they interact. UCâ€™s planning program has a strong focus on design, which included 7 studios geared towards architectural drafting, landscape architecture, and rendering. Also, I was required to intern a total of 18 months to complete my degree. I helped with conceptual site design for Disney Vacation Suites while at Walt Disney World in Orlando, and I even had the opportunity to work in a remote city in Sardinia, Italy, helping the city to enhance its tourism through Art and Design...takes breath.</p>
  <p>After I finished my degree at UC, I decided to delve back into the world of tech and management. I have spent about 6 years working in the tech industry as a technical support representative, a supervisor, and participated in project management. I am adept in networking technologies, and an expert in the OS X operating system. Recently, I took a leave of absence from Apple to pursue development in Chicago at Dev Bootcamp. I have since graduated, and am currently looking for a place to call home where I can express myself both as web developer and a designer.</p>
